IRCA made it illegal to employ\nunauthorized aliens, established an employment\neligibility verification system, and created various civil\nand criminal penalties against employers who violate\nthe law. 8 U.S.C. § 1324a.\n    Regulations implementing IRCA created a “Form I-\n9” that employers are required to have all prospective\nemployees complete—citizens and aliens alike. IRCA\ncontains an “express preemption provision, which in\nmost instances bars States from imposing penalties on\nemployers of unauthorized aliens,” Arizona v. United\nStates, 567 U.S. 387, 406 (2012), but IRCA “is silent\nabout whether additional penalties may be imposed\nagainst the employees themselves.” Id. IRCA also\nprovides that “[the Form I-9] and any information\ncontained in or appended to such form, may not be used\nfor purposes other than enforcement of [chapter 12 of\nTitle 8] and sections 1001, 1028, 1546, and 1621 of Title\n18.” 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(5).\n   Here, Respondents used other peoples’ social\nsecurity numbers to complete documents, including a\nForm I-9, a federal W-4 tax form, a state K-4 tax form,\nand an apartment lease.

Whether IRCA expressly preempts the States\nfrom using any information entered on or appended to\na federal Form I-9, including common information such\nas name, date of birth, and social security number, in\na prosecution of any person (citizen or alien) when that\nsame, commonly used information also appears in non-\nIRCA documents, such as state tax forms, leases, and\ncredit applications.\n   2. If IRCA bars the States from using all such\ninformation for any purpose, whether Congress has the\nconstitutional power to so broadly preempt the States\nfrom exercising their traditional police powers to\nprosecute state law crimes.\n\f                                   iii",

(No. 17-\n986), this matter revolves around the determination\nof arbitrability of claims. The bias in favor of\narbitration increasingly causes courts to overlook\nthe underlying intent of the parties while also\nrendering the civil jury trial an endangered species.\nMore specifically, federal courts of appeals have\nheld that the mere incorporation in contracts of\ncertain common rules of self-interested private\narbitration companies evinces a “clear and\nunmistakable” intent that arbitrators should decide\nthe “gateway” issue of whether a particular dispute\nis covered by an agreement to arbitrate. At the same\ntime, often the dispute at issue has nothing to do\nwith the contract containing the arbitration clause\nand should never involve the arbitral process.\n\n       To avoid compelling arbitration of every\ndispute — no matter how far removed from the\nsubject matter of such a contract — four circuit\ncourts have adopted some version of the “wholly\ngroundless” test, while two other circuits have\nrejected it.\n\n      The questions presented here are:\n\n      1. Whether a court must grant a motion to\n         compel arbitration of the gateway\n         question of arbitrability, even where a\n         contract containing an arbitration clause\n         is unrelated to the parties’ instant\n\f                   ii\n\n\n   dispute, or whether the court should deny\n   the motion where the arbitrability\n   argument is “wholly groundless”?\n\n2. Whether the express intent of the parties\n   to resolve arbitrability through the courts\n   consistent with the Federal Arbitration\n   Act is superseded by the general broad\n   reference to commercial arbitration rules?\n\f                         iii\n\n\n        RULE 14.1(b) PARTIES TO THE\n               PROCEEDING\n\n       Petitioner Simply Wireless, Inc. was the\nplaintiff in the district court and the appellant in\nthe court of appeals.\n\n      Respondents T-Mobile US, Inc. f/k/a T-\nMobile USA Inc., and T-Mobile USA Inc. were the\ndefendants in the district court and the appellees in\nthe court of appeals.",

The study found that non-whites accused of killing white\nmales are statistically more likely to receive a sentence of death in Oklahoma on\nthat basis alone, and controlling for other aggravating circumstances.\n\n       Under Oklahoma’s post-conviction statute, a death-sentenced prisoner has\njust sixty days to file a successor post-conviction application based upon newly\navailable evidence. In compliance with this rule, Mr. Wood filed a post-conviction\napplication in the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (“OCCA”) wherein he\nargued that this study constituted new evidence that he was convicted and\nsentenced to death in violation of his rights under the Oklahoma Constitution, as\nwell as under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.\nConstitution. The OCCA denied Mr. Wood’s successor application on the basis of a\nstate procedural bar.\n\n      The questions presented by this case are the following:\n\n      1.     Whether a complex statistical study that indicates a risk that\n             racial considerations enter into Oklahoma’s capital-sentencing\n             determinations proves that Mr. Wood’s death sentence is\n             unconstitutional under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n             Amendments to the United States Constitution?\n\n      2.

The study found that non-whites accused of killing\nwhite males are statistically more likely to receive a sentence of death in Oklahoma\non that basis alone, and controlling for other aggravating circumstances.\n\n       Under Oklahoma’s post-conviction statute, a death-sentenced prisoner has just\nsixty days to file a successor post-conviction application based upon newly-discovered\nevidence. In compliance with this rule, Mr. Jones filed a post-conviction application\nin the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (“OCCA”) wherein he argued that this\nstudy constituted newly-discovered evidence that he was convicted and sentenced to\ndeath in violation of his rights under the Oklahoma Constitution, as well as under\nthe Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The OCCA\ndenied Mr. Jones’ successor application on the basis of a state procedural bar.\n\n      The questions presented by this case are the following:\n\n      1.     Whether a complex statistical study that indicates a risk that\n             racial considerations enter into Oklahoma’s capital sentencing\n             determinations proves that Mr. Jones’ death sentence is\n             unconstitutional under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth\n             Amendments to the United States Constitution?\n\n      2.     Whether Oklahoma’s capital post-conviction statute, specifically\n             Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 1089(D)(8)(b), and the Oklahoma Court\n             of Criminal Appeals’ application of the statute in Mr. Jones’ case,\n             denies Mr. Jones an adequate corrective process for the hearing\n             and determination of his newly-available federal constitutional\n             claim in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth\n             Amendment’s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses?\n\n                                          ii",

Instead\nof buying the land, however, the County wielded its\nregulatory authority to block the Leones from developing\ntheir property in any way.\n\n     The Leones challenged the County’s refusal to allow\nthem to use or develop their property as a taking under\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and sought just\ncompensation. In particular, the Leones claimed they had\nsuffered a “categorical” regulatory taking because the\nCounty had forced them to keep their land “substantially\nin its natural state.” Lucas v.

First, the undeveloped\nproperty still had “investment use” because the Leones\ncould sell it. Second, the undeveloped property could be\nused as a beach park at which the Leones potentially could\nsell concessions.\n\n    The question presented is:\n\n    W hether holding undeveloped property as an\n“investment” or using it as a “park” in its natural state\nconstitutes economically beneficial or productive use of\nland under Lucas v.

Since that time, courts have divided on\nwhether houses of worship can be excluded from\nhistoric preservation programs consistent with the\nFree Exercise Clause.

See CSX Transp., Inc.\nv. Ala. Dep’t of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277 (2010). In its\nsecond opinion, the Court held that the lower courts\nmust look outside the challenged sales-and-use tax to\ndetermine whether Alabama could justify the exemp-\ntions. See Alabama Dep’t of Revenue v. CSX Transp.,\nInc., 135 S.Ct. 1136 (2015).\n    On remand, the district court held a 4-day trial and\nfound that Alabama justified both exemptions. The\nEleventh Circuit agreed that Alabama justified the\ntruck exemption but held that Alabama had not justi-\nfied the water carrier exemption. It therefore ordered\nthe district court to enjoin the tax.\n   Rail carriers and States have fought over water\ncarrier exemptions for more than 20 years. The issue\nis presently pending in multiple actions that lower\ncourts have stayed pending resolution of this case.\n   The question left open by the Court in CSX II and\npresented here is\n   Under 49 U.S.C. § 11501(b)(4), when can a\n   State justifiably maintain a sales-and-use\n   tax exemption for fuel used by vessels to\n   transport goods interstate without extending\n   the same exemption to rail carriers?\n\f                          ii",

The Circuits, however, have adopted\na definition of \"confidential\" that departs from the term's ordinary meaning, holding that this\nexemption applies only if disclosure is \"likely * * * to cause substantial harm to the competitive\nposition of\" the source of the information. Nat'l Parks & Conservation Ass'n v. Morton, 498 F.2d\n765,770 (D.C. Cir.1974). The D.C.

Does the statutory term \"confidential\" in FOIA Exemption 4 bear its ordinary meaning,\nthus requiring the Government to withhold all \"commercial or financial information\" that is\nconfidentially held and not publicly disseminated-regardless of whether a party establishes\nsubstantial competitive harm from disclosure-which would resolve at least five circuit splits?\n        2.

In 2016, this Court af-\nfirmed, by an equally divided Court, a decision of the\nFifth Circuit holding that two related Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS) discretionary enforcement\npolicies, including an expansion of the DACA policy,\nwere likely unlawful and should be enjoined. See\nUnited States v. Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2271 (per curiam). In\nSeptember 2017, DHS determined that the original\nDACA policy was unlawful and would likely be struck\ndown by the courts on the same grounds as the related\npolicies. DHS thus instituted an orderly wind-down of\nthe DACA policy. The questions presented are as follows:\n   1. Whether DHS’s decision to wind down the DACA\npolicy is judicially reviewable.\n   2. Whether DHS’s decision to wind down the DACA\npolicy is lawful.\n\n\n\n\n                          (I)",

Upon conviction for operating under the influence (“’OUI”), a motorist who\n\nhas refused to submit to a warrantless blood test is, inter alia, subject to a mandatory\n\nminimum period of 96 hours’ incarceration by virtue of that refusal.\n\n      Petitioner submitted to a blood test after the police warned her that failure to\n\ndo so would expose her to a mandatory minimum jail sentence if she were convicted.\n\nIn a 4-3 decision, a majority of the Maine Supreme Court held that Maine’s implied-\n\nconsent statute did not impose “criminal penalties” because it did not create a\n\nseparate, independent charge for refusing to submit to testing. Therefore, the court\n\nreasoned, Petitioner’s consent was voluntary and not induced by unconstitutional\n\ncoercion. This holding conflicts with the decisions of three other state courts. Only\n\none other state court has agreed with Maine, in an unpublished opinion.\n\n      The Question Presented is:\n\n\n      Does a motorist voluntarily consent to a warrantless blood draw if she has been\n\nwarned that refusal to submit will result in a mandatory minimum period of\n\nincarceration upon conviction?\n\n\n\n                                           i \n \n\f ",

      "qp": "This Court granted Mr. Haynes’ petition for certiorari and remanded this case to the Fifth\nCircuit, Haynes v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 1015 (2013), “to allow Haynes to pursue his ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claim on remand if this Court in Trevino [v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 413 (2013)]\nrejects the single ground relied upon by the Fifth Circuit for denying Haynes’ application for a\ncertificate of appealability.” Haynes v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 639 (2012) (mem.) (Statement of\nSotomayor, J, and Ginsburg, J., respecting grant of stay of execution). The Fifth Circuit in turn\ngranted a certificate of appealability (“COA”) and remanded the case to the district court. Yet there\nwas no real review of the merits of Haynes’ claim, just a “facial review” that did not consider the\nunderlying facts of the claim, by that Court’s own admission.\n        A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit then denied relief, despite the dissent’s holding that\n“Haynes presents a substantial ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim that has never been\nproperly considered and ...the district court abused its discretion in failing to reopen his case.”\nHaynes v. Davis, 733 F. App’x 766, 771 (Dennis, J., dissenting) (App. A 4). The dissent also found\nthat “the district court failed to consider all of the relevant factors and misevaluated the factors it\ndid consider;” that there was no real merits review; that the claim was substantial; and that a major\nground relied upon by the majority, “finality,” was not a decisive factor in the context of Rule 60(b).\n(App. A 4-8). Another ground for denial, that the claim under Rule 60(b)(6) was an impermissible\n“substitute for appeal,” was inapplicable, as the rationale for Trevino was that it applied in states\nwhere the IATC claim could not practically be brought on appeal.\n\n       This case therefore presents the following questions:\n\n       1. Did the Fifth Circuit majority err in finding that there were no “extraordinary\ncircumstances” and that the claim was not sufficiently “substantial” to warrant relief under Rule\n60(b)(6)?\n\n        2. Did the Fifth Circuit majority err in holding that Haynes’ claim had been considered on\nthe merits and that the district court’s “facial review” was sufficient when the underlying facts of\nthe claim were not considered and there was no real merits review?\n\n        3. Did the Fifth Circuit majority contravene Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) and\nBuck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759 (2017) in holding that “finality” is a determinative factor in the context\nof Rule 60(b), and did it err in holding that the claim was merely a “substitute for appeal” when it\ncould not have been brought on appeal?\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -ii-",

      "qp": "Roger Epperson has always maintained his innocence, desired an innocence defense,\nand understood trial counsel would present an innocence defense. Counsel, however,\nconceded guilt on some of the charged offenses, as the lower court expressly\nrecognized, after telling the jury during opening statements that Epperson was\ninnocent of all charges (two murders, robbery, and burglary, all as either a principal\nor an accomplice) and that the defense would ask the jury to render a not guilty\nverdict on all charges.\n\nWithout first informing or consulting Epperson, during cross-examination of a\nprosecution witness the day before the trial ended, trial counsel asked the witness,\n“now the plan was for Roger [Epperson] to wait in the automobile, right?” She\nanswered affirmatively, only for trial counsel to then elicit from her that she had\nheard Epperson say after the crime that he could see his codefendants enter the\nvictims’ home. The next day, also without first consulting Epperson or even informing\nEpperson that counsel had unilaterally decided to abandon the innocence defense\nEpperson had informed counsel he wanted presented, trial counsel told the jury that\nEpperson had waited in the getaway car while his codefendants committed the\nrobbery, burglary, and murders. Not only does that concede guilt of burglary and\nrobbery, it was also sufficient to find Epperson guilty of murder by complicity, as the\njury found.\n\nIn post-conviction proceedings, Epperson argued that trial counsel presented\ninconsistent theories when he began by telling the jury Epperson was innocent, but\nthen conceded guilt. The post-conviction court rejected the claim, finding, as the lower\ncourt did in Hashimi v. United States, which the Court recently granted, vacated,\nand remanded in light of McCoy v. Louisiana, that trial counsel made a strategic\ndecision to concede guilt of some of the charged offenses, and the strategic decision\nwas reasonable.\n\nWhile Epperson’s case was pending on appeal, this Court decided McCoy v. Louisiana,\n138 S. Ct. 1500 (2018), holding that counsel cannot concede guilt when the defendant\ndesires an innocence defense. In light of McCoy, Epperson argued that his\nconstitutional rights were violated when counsel conceded guilt over his request that\ncounsel present an innocence defense, and requested remand to further develop the\nfacts in this regard. The Kentucky Supreme Court found that trial counsel\n“concede[d] involvement in the robbery and burglary.” Epperson v. Commonwealth,\n2018 WL 3920226, *4 (Ky.). Yet, the court denied a remand and rejected the McCoy\nclaim because “[t]his concession does not appear to be the type of concession upon\nwhich McCoy’s holding is predicated,” and Epperson “has not evidenced intransigent\n                                           i\n\for vociferous objection to trial counsel’s strategy . . . at every opportunity, before and\nduring trial, both in conference with his lawyer and in open court.” Id. at *10-12.\n\nThis gives rise to the following question presented, for which a summary grant,\nvacate, and remand for further proceedings in light of McCoy would be appropriate.\nThis is particularly so because that is exactly what the Court did in Hashimi v. United\nStates, where counsel also conceded guilt during closing argument without first\ninforming Hashimi, and where the record was not entirely clear that Hashimi\nrequested counsel refrain from admitting guilt.\n\n      Is a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the right to control the\n      objective of the defense, violated, under the Court’s recent decision of McCoy\n      v. Louisiana, 138 S. Ct. 1500 (2018), when, after settling on an innocence\n      defense the client desired, and after informing the jury that the client is\n      innocent, counsel concedes, during closing argument, guilt of some of the\n      charged offenses without first informing and consulting the client?\n\n\n\n\n                                            ii",

Florida, 490 U.S. 638\n\n(1989), (b) invalidated Florida's capital punishment statute, and (c) held that all facts\n\nnecessary to impose a sentence of death must be based on a jury's verdict, not a\n\njudge’s fact finding. Hurst, 136 S. Ct. at 624.\n\n      Under Ohio's capital punishment statute, “[a]ll the power to impose the\n\npunishment of death resides in the trial court which oversees the mitigation or\n\npenalty phase of the trial” and renders specific factual findings necessary to impose\n\nthe death penalty. State v. Rogers, 28 Ohio St.3d 427, 429, 505 N.E.2d 52, 55 (1986).\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio, citing Spaziano, has repeatedly held that Ohio’s death\n\npenalty statutory scheme procedure does not violate the Sixth or Eighth\n\nAmendments.\n\n      Lawrence Landrum was sentenced under this judge-sentencing scheme where\n\na jury’s death verdict is merely a recommendation. The judge alone makes findings\n\nessential to the death penalty and decides whether to sentence a defendant to life or\n\ndeath.\n\n      Mr. Landrum, in his motion for a new mitigation trial, moved the trial court to\n\nvacate his death sentence in accordance with Hurst. The state court denied his\n\nmotion, the state court of appeals affirmed that decision, albeit for different\n\nreasoning, and the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to exercise its discretionary\n\njurisdiction to review the court of appeals’ decision.\n\n\n                                            i\n\f      Given that this Court in Hurst explicitly overruled Spaziano, and the Supreme\n\nCourt of Ohio repeatedly relied on Spaziano, in upholding Ohio’s death scheme in\n\nwhich the trial judge independently makes the ultimate decision as to whether the\n\naggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors and the defendant should\n\nbe sentenced to death, the following question is presented:\n\n\n             Is Ohio's death penalty scheme unconstitutional under\n             Hurst v.

Oklahoma prosecutors consistently exploited\n\nthis instruction in closing arguments to impermissibly narrow the scope\n\nof evidence the jury could consider mitigating and argue there had to be\n\na connection between the mitigating circumstances and the crime.\n\nTroubled by prosecutors’ constant attempts to limit jurors’ consideration\n\nof mitigating evidence, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA)\n\nwarned prosecutors not to argue mitigating circumstances were limited\n\nto those that extenuate a defendant’s moral culpability or guilt for the\n\ncapital offense. Harris v. State, 164 P.3d 1103, 1113-14 (Okla. Crim. App.\n\n2007). Further, the court referred the matter to the Oklahoma Uniform\n\nJury Instruction Committee “for promulgation of a modified jury\n\ninstruction defining mitigating circumstances in capital cases.” Id. at\n\n1114.     Mr. Grant did not receive the modified instruction and the\n\n\n\n                                     1\n\fprosecutor made the same arguments the OCCA found “egregious” in\n\nHarris. Id. The OCCA reversed itself and found such arguments proper in\n\nMr. Grant’s case. With this background in place, the following question\n\nwarrants this Court’s review:\n\n     When a jury instruction defines mitigating circumstances as\n     “those which in fairness, sympathy, and mercy, may extenuate\n     or reduce the degree of moral culpability or blame” and\n     prosecutors deliberately and repeatedly rely on such\n     instruction to argue the defendant’s evidence must reduce the\n     moral culpability or blame of the defendant for the murder to\n     be considered mitigating, is a state court’s conclusion such\n     prosecutorial argument is proper contrary to Lockett v.

In\nthis case, the government dismissed a first indictment against Mr. Weiss, but made\nclear that it was \"committed to re-indicting\" him, and communicated that\n\"commitment to Mr. Weiss' counsel and to the court in unequivocal terms.\" The\nquestion presented is:\n  Whether Mr. Weiss was denied his right to conflict-free counsel during grand jury\nproceedings, and a Certificate of Appealability should have issued, where the\ngovernment had committed itself to prosecute and the adverse positions of the\ngovernment and Mr. Weiss had solidified?\n\n    A criminal defendant has a right to one full and fair opportunity to have his first\n28 U.S.C. §2255 motion considered by the district court. §2255(a). See 141 Cong.\nRec. S7803, S7809 (1995) (statement of Senator Kennedy) (\"[L]imi[ing] inmates\nto one bite at the apple is sound in principle\") (italics added). In this case, Mr.\nWeiss, through counsel, filed a Section 2255 motion. On the same day, Mr. Weiss\nfiled a pro se motion under 2255, and a motion to file pro se pleadings. As cause,\nMr. Weiss, by unsworn declaration, explained that (1) he is financially unable to\npay his attorney to perfect any arguments other than those presented in his\ncounseled 2255 motion, and (2) regardless, his attorney informed him that he could\nnot review any additional arguments because there was not enough time for him to\ndue so, considering the voluminous record in his case. Without determining\nwhether Mr. Weiss had stated cause for him to file pro se arguments, the court\ndenied the pro se motion and request to file pro se pleadings. The question presented\nis:\n  Whether Mr. Weiss was denied access to the courts, or, appropriate review, and\na Certificate of Appealability should have issued, where he could not afford to pay\nhis attorney to perfect his arguments, and, further, where his attorney informed him\nthat, regardless, he could not perfect any other arguments because he would not\nhave time to review the record, thus entitling him to file pro se pleadings?\n\f                                              11",
