Stogner involved a sexual abuse report\n25 years after the alleged abuse and was based on\nrecovered memory. This case, by contrast, involves the\n1987 rape of an 8-year-old who immediately reported\nthe crime; the suspected rapist’s identity was\ndiscovered only after the crime lab entered Ronald\nTipton’s DNA profile into CODIS in 2014 as part of a\nseparate criminal case and found that it matched the\nunsolved rape.

The bonds are secured by a lien on toll\nrevenues as directed by Puerto Rico statute and HTA\nregulations. Since before its bankruptcy filing, HTA\nhas been spending all the toll revenues, and has\nannounced its intention to continue spending these\nrevenues indefinitely, leaving Petitioner unpaid.\n\n    Under the Bankruptcy Code, a “lien” is defined as\na “charge against or interest in property to secure\npayment of a debt,” 11 U.S.C. §101(37), and is entitled\nto protection depending on its type: whether it is a\n“statutory lien,” a “security interest,” or a “judicial\nlien,” id., §§101(53), (51), (36). The First Circuit held\nthat Petitioner’s lien is not a statutory lien because,\neven though the lien is imposed unilaterally by\nstatutory and agency regulation, the lien’s elements\nare not all set out in a statute; some are specified in\nHTA’s regulations as a matter of discretionary agency\naction. In contrast, the Third and Ninth Circuits have\ndetermined that a statutory lien need not be specified\nentirely in a statute, and may arise as a matter of\ndiscretionary agency action. Likewise, the Fifth\nCircuit has held that a lien imposed unilaterally by\noperation of law, as opposed to one arising from\nbilateral agreement, is properly a statutory lien. The\nquestion presented is:\n\n   Should the Court grant certiorari to resolve a\nconflict among the courts of appeals over the correct\nlegal standard for determining whether a lien is a\n“statutory lien” under the Bankruptcy Code?\n\f                          ii",

United Auto., Aerospace and Agriculture Implement\nWorkers of America, 523 U.S. 653, 118 S.Ct. 1626, 140\nL.Ed. 2d 863 (1998), this Court held that, where\nneither the employer nor the labor organization\nasserts that there has been a breach of a labor\nagreement, federal courts do not have jurisdiction over\na suit seeking to invalidate the agreement. In so\nholding, however, the Court noted that “a declaratory\njudgment plaintiff accused of violating a collective-\nbargaining agreement may ask a [federal] court to\ndeclare the agreement invalid.” Id. at 658.\n  Petitioner Nu Image and Respondent IATSE en-\ntered into a collective bargaining agreement, which\nNu Image claims was fraudulently induced based on\nIATSE’s representations that Nu Image would not\nhave to make any residual contributions to IATSE’s\nhealth and pension plans. The plans, third-party\nbeneficiaries of the collective bargaining agreement,\nsued Nu Image in federal district court, claiming that\nNu Image breached the agreement by failing to make\nresidual contributions. Under established authority,\nNu Image was unable to raise IATSE’s fraud as a\ndefense and it settled with the plans. Thereafter,\nIATSE filed an arbitration against Nu Image, also\nclaiming that Nu Image breached the collective\nbargaining agreement by failing to make residual\ncontributions to the plans. In that arbitration, the\narbitrator may be without power to consider Nu\nImage’s fraud defense.\n\n                           (i)\n\f                            ii\n   Accordingly, Nu Image filed suit in federal district\ncourt against IATSE for fraud and declaratory relief.\nIn a decision that misinterprets this Court’s decision\nin Textron and conflicts with decisions from the Fifth\nand Seventh Circuits, the Ninth Circuit held that\nSection 301(a) permits the exercise of jurisdiction only\nwhen a plaintiff asserts that a defendant breached a\nlabor agreement. As a result, the Ninth Circuit\naffirmed the district court’s dismissal of Nu Image’s\nlawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, effec-\ntively precluding Nu Image from seeking any relief for\nthe millions of dollars of damages it has suffered as a\nresult of IATSE’s fraud.\n  Against this factual backdrop, the question pre-\nsented by this Petition is:\n  Do federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to Section 301(a) of the Labor Management\nRelations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a) over a complaint for\nintentional and negligent misrepresentation and\ndeclaratory relief, where the lawsuit seeks relief from\nclaims that the plaintiff violated the parties’ collective\nbargaining agreement?\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\f                    iii",

For example, Argersinger\nv. Hamlin held “that absent a knowing and intelligent\nwaiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, …\nunless he was represented by counsel at his trial.”\n407 U.S. 25, 37 (1972). And Faretta v. California cau-\ntioned that, before a criminal defendant may waive his\nrepresentation and conduct his own defense, he must\n“clearly and unequivocally declare[] to the trial judge\nthat he want[s] to represent himself and d[oes] not\nwant counsel,” and the record must reflect that he is\n“voluntarily exercising his informed free will.” 422 U.S.\n806, 835-36 (1975). Moreover, this Court has suggested\nthat although “[s]ome rights may be forfeited by means\nshort of waiver,” the right to counsel “may not.” Freytag\nv. Comm’r, 501 U.S. 868, 894 n.2 (1991) (Scalia, J., con-\ncurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n     In this case, an indigent capital defendant was forced\nto represent himself—at his trial and death-penalty sen-\ntencing stage—not because he waived the right to repre-\nsentation voluntarily on the record, but as an “extreme\nsanction” for his alleged misconduct. Courts of last resort\nare split on whether criminal defendants in any case (let\nalone capital cases) may be forced to represent them-\nselves pro se in this fashion. The Question Presented is:\n    Does depriving a criminal defendant of trial counsel\nagainst his will, without at least the warnings and vol-\nuntary waiver required by Faretta, violate the Sixth\nAmendment?\n\f                                   ii",

If “broadcasting over the air\non a channel” is the same as “operating on a channel,”\nhundreds of television stations which have heretofore\nqualified for “must-carry” status on local cable\ntelevision systems will now lose their cable carriage\nrights and protections.

      "qp": "The questions presented are i) whether at least\nsome types of limited liability companies may be\nconsidered a “person” and thus a “customer” under the\nRight to Financial Privacy Act for purposes of allowing\nsuch companies to sue the United States, and\nii) whether the scope of jurisdictional discovery should\nbe broadened when, absent such discovery, the doors to\nfederal court are left closed and viable claims are left\nunaddressed.\n    The Federal Right to Financial Privacy Act (“RFPA”\nor “Act”), 12 U.S.C. § 3401, et seq. was enacted in 1978\nas part of the Financial Institutions Regulatory and\nInterest Rate Control Act. The RFPA limits the ability\nof the federal government to obtain information kept in\nthe financial records of banks. Congress enacted the\nRFPA in the wake of United States v. Miller, 425 U.S.\n435, 442 (1976), which held that no “legitimate\nexpectation of privacy” exists in “the information kept\nin bank records”, and thus such records are beyond the\nprotections of the Fourth Amendment.\n   The RFPA provides for a private cause of action\nwhen the restrictions set forth therein are not followed,\nthereby waiving the United States’ sovereign\nimmunity.\n    The private cause of action provided to a “customer”\nof financial institutions whose financial records are\nimproperly obtained or disclosed by the government is\nset forth in § 3417. This provision allows plaintiffs to\nrecover damages, including “punitive damages as the\ncourt may allow, where the violation is found to have\n\f                            ii\n\nbeen willful or intentional” as well as attorney’s fees.\n12 U.S.C. § 3417(a)(3).\n    The RFPA defines “customer” as “any person or\nauthorized representative of that person who utilized\nor is utilizing any service of a financial institution, or\nfor whom a financial institution is acting or has acted\nas a fiduciary, in relation to an account maintained in\nthe person’s name.” 12 U.S.C. § 3401(5). In turn, the\nterm “person” is defined as “an individual or a\npartnership of five or fewer individuals.” 12 U.S.C.\n§ 3410(4).\n    Petitioners, including the limited liability company\nPetitioners (“LLC Petitioners”) filed suit as class\nrepresentatives alleging that the Government violated\nthe RFPA when it wrongfully obtained banking records\nby way of secret John Doe summonses. In an issue of\nfirst impression, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the\ndistrict court that limited liability companies are not\n“persons” and thus not “customers” under the RFPA\nsuch that the LLC Petitioners’ claims were barred by\nsovereign immunity. In addition, the Sixth Circuit\nagreed with the unduly limited scope of jurisdictional\ndiscovery afforded Petitioners by the district court,\nwhich left Petitioners hamstrung in establishing that\nthe bank records of individuals were wrongfully\nobtained by way of these secret John Doe summonses.\n   Petitioners now seek review of the questions\npresented as set forth above.\n\f                          iii",

E.E.O.C., 565 U.S. 171, 195 n.4\n(2012), this Court opined that church disputes over\nministry are not per se exempt from judicial scrutiny\nunder church autonomy principles, and that they\nshould instead be treated as affirmative defenses,\nleading to further confusion in the application of this\nprecedent in the lower courts.\n    After nearly a quarter century of litigation, the\ncourt below—ostensibly following “neutral principles”\nas contemplated by Wolf—has directed that a non-\nmember of a religious community be installed in the\nhighest leadership position of the Church of the Lord\nJesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, displacing its\nduly elected leader. The case below thus presents a\nmatter for plenary review related to the inconsistent\napplication of this Court’s precedent:\n       Whether this Court should clarify Jones\n       v. Wolf and Hosanna-Tabor v. E.E.O.C.,\n       given the doctrinal uncertainty and\n       unpredictability reflected in inconsistent\n\f                    ii\n\n\napplication in federal and state courts,\nand limit the ability of courts to disregard\ncore church autonomy principles in the\nadjudication of intra-church disputes.\n\f                        iii",

      "qp": "Question 1\n\n      In Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86 (2011), this Court\nannounced that where a state court issues a summary denial of a\nhabeas petitioner’s claim unaccompanied by any reasoning, a federal\ncourt reviewing that claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) determines\nwhether “any reasonable basis” could have supported the denial. If so,\nthe federal court must defer to the state adjudication.\n\n       Last term, in Wilson v. Sellers, 584 U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 1188 (2018),\nthis Court rejected the Eleventh Circuit’s expansive application of\nRichter, clarifying that Richter’s “any reasonable basis” inquiry is\nlimited to the circumstances where no state court has issued a reasoned\nopinion in support of its adjudication. This Court further noted that\nwhere, as in Mr. Morrow’s case, the last state court to adjudicate the\nmerits of the claim did so in a reasoned opinion, review under § 2254(d)\nis “straightforward.” Id. at 1192. The federal court “simply reviews the\nspecific reasons given by the state court and defers to those reasons if\nthey are reasonable.” Id.\n\n     The Eleventh Circuit’s opinion affirming Morrow’s denial of\nhabeas relief, issued three weeks prior to Wilson, presents the following\nquestion:\n\n     Where the last state court to review the merits of a state\n     prisoner’s habeas claim denied relief in a reasoned opinion,\n     may a federal court assume the existence of fact-findings and\n     clear error determinations not contained in the state court’s\n     opinion to conclude that the state court’s adjudication is\n     reasonable and therefore bars federal relief under § 2254(d)?\n\n                                     i\n\f                            Question 2\n\n      This Court has long recognized the uniquely devastating nature of\nchildhood sexual abuse, identifying repeated childhood sexual assault\nas “powerful” mitigating evidence. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 535\n(2003). Yet the Eleventh Circuit has a consistent practice of refusing to\nweigh, or sanctioning a state court’s unreasonable discounting of,\ncredible evidence of repeated childhood sexual abuse. This case,\ntherefore, also presents the following question:\n\n     Whether the Eleventh Circuit erroneously concluded that\n     the Georgia Supreme Court reasonably determined that:\n\n           a) the fact that Morrow was “the victim of a series of\n           rapes” as a child “would not have been given great\n           weight by the jury,” and\n\n           b) Morrow’s counsel did not perform deficiently in\n           failing to discover this evidence because Morrow did\n           not volunteer information about his sexual abuse?\n\n\n\n\n                                    ii",

      "qp": "CAPITAL CASE\n\n        In Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 272 (1976), this Court upheld Texas' capital sentencing\n\nstatute against a challenge of facial vagueness on representations by the Court of Criminal Appeals\n\n\nthat it would interpret a special question sufficiently broadly to allow a sentencing jury to consider\n\nthe full breadth of mitigating evidence offered. When that promise was not fulfilled m a later case,\n\nthis Court reversed a death sentence. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302,328 (1989). Similarly,\n\n\nthe State of Arizona represented to this Court in its brief in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990),\n\nthat the facially vague statutory aggravating factor at issue here would be narrowed. The Arizona\n\n\nSupreme Court later held that it had not consistently narrowed that factor. See State v. Bocharskf,\n\n\n218 Ariz.476,494, 189 P.3d 403, 421 (2008). In Gulbrandson, in a successive collateral relief\n\nproceeding, the state court misapplied the narrowing required by Bocharskiy leavmg the sole\n\n\nstatutory aggravator un-narrowed. The district court denied relief, and that court and the Ninth\n\n\nCircuit denied a certificate ofappealability. The questions presented for review are:\n\n\n\n       (1) Whether reasonable jurists would debate the correctness of the district\n       court's procedural ruling that Gulbrandson s second-m-time § 2254 petition was\n       second or successive for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(B), where its factual\n       predicate was a new merits judgment of death eligibility under A.R.S. § 13-\n       703(F)(6), in a successive post-conviction relief proceeding, and, therefore, the\n       claim, was unripe at the time he filed his the initial § 2254 petition; and^\n\n\n       (2) Whether reasonable jurists would debate whether Gulbrandson pleaded a\n       substantial Eighth Amendment claim v^here the state court failed to apply a\n       narrowing construction- to the \"especially heinous or depraved\" statutory\n       aggravating factor found to be facially vague in Walton^ see A.R.S. § 13-703(F)(6),\n       by failing to apply the crucial curative mental state element prescribed byBocharskf\n       to prescribe when the infliction of injuries is \"gratuitous,\" itself a narrowing\n       definition of(F)(6), which resulted in Gulbrandson's being found eligible for death\n       based solely on the finding of an un-narrowed statutory aggmvator.",

Critically, however, the Court did not explicitly specify when a criminal\n\ndefendant must invoke this right.\n\n      At a trial readiness hearing in California state court three days before his\n\njury was impaneled, Petitioner Dalray Kwane Andrews made a clear and\n\nunequivocal request to represent himself under Faretta. The state trial court\n\ndenied Andrews’ request as untimely. The trial court then forced Andrews to\n\nproceed to trial with appointed counsel. On direct appeal, the state appellate court\n\naffirmed the trial court’s decision, agreeing that Andrews’ request was untimely and\n\nadditionally holding that it was dilatory.\n\n      On federal habeas review, the Ninth Circuit concluded the state appellate\n\ncourt’s denial of Andrews’ request on these two grounds was not unreasonable\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Speaking to the timeliness of Andrews’ request, the\n\nNinth Circuit held Faretta “clearly established,” for purposes of 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d)(1), that Andrews had to make his request at least a few weeks before trial.\n\nThe questions presented here are:\n\n             (1) Did the Ninth Circuit err in holding that Faretta\n                 “clearly established,” for purposes of 28 U.S.C. §\n                 2254(d)(1), that a request for self-representation\n                 must be made at least a few weeks before trial?\n\n             (2) Did the Ninth Circuit err in holding the California\n                 Court of Appeal reasonably concluded Andrews’\n                 request for self-representation was dilatory?\n\n\n                                             i",

      "qp": "In Sessions v. Dimaya, 138 S. Ct. 1204, 1223 (2018) this Court recently\n\nstruck down as unconstitutionally vague the Immigration and Nationality Act’s\n\ndefinition of crime of violence, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 16(b). This case presents\n\nthree questions of first impression for this Court: (1) whether the residual clause of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(B), which is nearly identical to § 16(b), is also\n\nunconstitutionally vague, and if so, (2) whether aiding and abetting Hobbs Act\n\nRobbery constitutes a crime of violence under the “force” clause of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(3)(A), and finally, (3) whether the lower courts are to apply the categorical\n\napproach, or modified categorical approach, when considering whether a\n\ncontemporaneous charge of aiding and abetting Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of\n\nviolence under § 924(c)’s force clause.\n\n      As to the first question, at least three circuit courts have recently concluded\n\nthat the “residual” clause of 18 U.S.C. §n 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague.\n\nUnited States v. Salas, 889 F.3d 681, 686 (10th Cir. 2018); United States v. Davis,\n\n909 F.3d 483 (5th Cir. 2018); United States v. Eshetu, 898 F.3d 36, 37-38 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2018). The First Circuit, on the other hand, has questioned whether this Court’s\n\ndecision in Dimaya striking down § 16(b) leads to the conclusion that § 924(c)’s\n\nresidual clause should be subject to the same fate under the void-for-vagueness\n\ndoctrine. Brown v. United States, 906 F.3d 159 (Oct. 12, 2018). The Sixth Circuit,\n\nby contrast, is the only circuit to date that has upheld the constitutionality of the\n\nresidual clause set forth in § 924(c)(3)(B) while finding § 16(b) to be\n\n\n\n\n                                          i\n\funconstitutional. Compare Shuti v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 440 (6th Cir. 2016)(holding\n\nthat § 16(b) is unconstitutionally vague) with United States v. Taylor, 814 F.3d 340,\n\n375 (6th Cir. 2016)(rejecting a void-for-vagueness challenge to § 924(c)’s residual\n\nclause). Accordingly, there is a circuit split as to whether § 924(c)(3)(B)’s residual\n\nclause is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n      Assuming, arguendo, that the Court were to strike down the residual clause\n\nof § 924(c)(3)(B), the second question presented herein is whether aiding and\n\nabetting Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under the “force” clause\n\nof § 924(c)(3)(A). While the First, Tenth, Eleventh, and now the Sixth Circuit have\n\nanswered this question in the affirmative, see United States v. Garcia-Ortiz, 904\n\nF.3d 102 (1st Cir. Sept. 17, 2018); United States v. Deiter, 890 F.3d 1203, 1215-16\n\n(10th Cir. 2018); In re Colon, 826 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016), the reasoning of\n\nthese circuits appears to conflicts with this Court’s decision in Rosemond v. United\n\nStates, 572 U.S. 65 (2014).\n\n      Lastly, the circuit courts are split over the question of whether the categorical\n\napproach – or modified categorical approach – is to be employed where a defendant\n\nis contemporaneously charged with a crime such as aiding and abetting Hobbs Act\n\nrobbery and § 924(c). The majority of circuits, including the Second, Sixth, Seventh,\n\nand Eighth, have applied the categorical approach as laid out by this Court in\n\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 576 (1990). United States v. Hill, 890 F.3d 51 (2d\n\nCir. 2018); United States v. Gooch, 850 F.3d 285, 291-92 (6th Cir. 2017); United\n\nStates v. Rivera, 847 F.3d 847, 848-49 (7th Cir. 2017); United States v. House, 825\n\n\n\n\n                                          ii\n\fF.3d 381, 387 (8th Cir. 2016). By contrast, the Third Circuit has rejected the use of\n\nthe categorical approach in favor of the modified categorical approach in cases\n\ninvolving the contemporaneous charges of Hobbs Act robbery and § 924(c). United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 844 F.3d 137 (3d Cir. 2016). As such, there is a well-defined\n\ncircuit split as to which approach is to be applied in cases such as this where a\n\ndefendant is contemporaneously charged under § 924(c) and Hobbs Act robbery.\n\n\n\n\n                                         iii",

United States, 570 U.S. 254, 257 (11th Cir.\n2013). Additionally, under § 4B1.2(a)(1), any offense\npunishable by over a year that “has as an element the use,\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force against\nthe person of another[]” is a crime of violence.\n       This petition asks, first, what is the least culpable\nmental state that qualifies a state aggravated assault\noffense as generic: “knowledge, purpose, or intent,” as the\nNinth Circuit held in United States v. Garcia-Jimenez, 807\nF. 3d 1079, 1084, 1087 (9th Cir. 2015), “extreme\nindifference recklessness,” as the Fourth, Sixth, and\nEighth Circuits have held, see United States v.

United States, __ U.S.__, 136 S.\nCt. 2272 (2016); United States v. Schneider, 905 F.3d 1088\n(8th Cir. 2018), “ordinary recklessness,” as the Fifth\nCircuit held in United States v. Mungia-Portillo, 484 F. 3d\n813 (5th Cir. 2007), or the general intent to commit an act\nwithout a particular mens rea as to its consequences, as the\nEleventh Circuit held below.\n       Second, this petition asks whether the “use of\nphysical force” under § 4B1.2 (a)(1) encompasses crimes of\nrecklessness, like the analogous clause this Court\nconsidered in Voisine, 136 S. Ct. 2272, or if it excludes such\ncrimes, like the pure accidents that this Court found not to\nqualify as a “use of physical force against the person or\nproperty of another” in Leocal v.

DID THE DISTRICT COURT OF KANSAS'S INTERPRETION OF KANSAS\nSTATUTE AND KANSAS SUPREME COURT DECISION CREATE A CONSTITUTIONAL\nCONFLICT?\n\n\n        Will the Supreme Court allow the District of Kansas to expand the current Kansas Statute\nKSA 47-646 to allow officers of the law to execute a warrantless search of private property\narmed with assault rifles wIth sole intent to destroy the owners dogs based on a report of a\nlivestock attack that they did not witness. (This expansion of power also conflicts with Ks\nstatutes regarding how and when an animal can be destroyed after legal hearings and all other\nattempts to capture have been exhausted. KSA 21-6412.) \"According to Deputy Bethards, the\nKansas Supreme Court in McDonald Bowman, 433 P.2d 437 (Kan. 1967) interpreted this\nstatute to permit a person not only to kill an offending dog caught in the act... but to pursue and\nkill the dog after it has returned to its owners' land. But that case cannot be read as broadly as\nDeputy Bethards suggests.\" Mayfield v Bethards, 10t Circuit 2016.\n       Is there a degree of imminent danger created when allowing law enforcement officers to\narm themselves with military grade assault rifles and raid a private residence without a warrant\nin order to hunt down the owners dogs and shoot them when found. \"Significantly, neither\nSection 47-646 nor McDonald v Bowman addresses the killing of a dog on its owners property\nby either a third party or a police officer acting in his official capacity in response to an\naccusation by a livestock owner about an attack the third party or, police officer did not witness.\"\nMayfield v Bethards, 10th Circuit 2016\n       Does the governments interest in detaining a dog that resembles a dog reported to have\nattacked livestock override the protections of the Fourth Amendment to prevent an un warranted,\nheavily armed search and the reckless discharge of high-power rifles in the vicinity of children\nand other residents.\n       Can an officer of the law claim he came onto private property to 'capture' a dog when he\nadmittedly did not bring the leash he claims was in the car or attempt any other means of\nhandling the pet other than shooting her with an AR- 15.\n       Did the District Court error when ignoring the precedent of other Circuit courts when\ndetermining the legal implications of the Defendants complete lack of attempt to detain the dogs\nby any form of non-violent means. San Jose Charter of Hells AngelsMotorcycle Club v. City of\nSan Jose, 402, F.3d 962,975 (9th Cir.2005)\n\fIII.   WAS THE QUALIFIED IMMUNITY DEFENSE MISS-APPLIED?\n\n\n       Did the District Court of Kansas error when granting qualified immunity on the same\n                                                                                   0th\ndefense of reasonableness dismissed as inadequate for an immunity defense by the 1 circuit?\nMayfield Bethards, 10th Circuit 2016\n        Does the 2018 decision by the 101h Circuit conflict with other Circuits rulings on\nreasonableness as well as creating a conflict with its own prior ruling in Mayfield v Bethards,\n2016? \"We therefore hold that when Deputy Bethards seized the Mayfields' personal property by\nkilling their pet dog Majka in 2014, it was clear his actions would violate the Fourth Amendment\nabsent a warrant particularly describing the things to be seized.\" \"..The circumstances alleged\n                                            . . .\n\n\n\nin the complaint do not establish an exception to the warrant requirements as a matter of law.\"\nThe Defenses' justification for the warrantless seizure did not change through discovery or pre-\ntrial hearings, therefore does the Mayfields' complaint survive the qualified immunity defense?\n        Is it reasonable to conclude that the deputies displayed an immediate 'consciousness of\nguilt' when they admittedly moved the deceased dog off of the front porch and carried her\nbloody corpse over 50 feet north of the house and placed her in a row of bushes and small trees\nmaking her nearly invisible from the road? Is qualified immunity a proper defense for those\nwho knowingly violate the law? Malley v. Biggs, 475 U.S. 335,343,341, (1986).\n\n\nIV.  DID THE DISTRICT COURT OF KANSAS ERROR WHEN GRANTING SUMMARY\nJUDGEMENT IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANT?\n\n\n       Did the District Court of Kansas error when granting the Defense summary judgement\nwhen there was multiple disputes over material facts?\n       Did the District Court of Kansas error when it did not follow the standard of review when\nignoring the multiple obstructions of justice during discovery including the refusal to provide the\nvideo recordings from the three official vehicles present during the incident. Should the\nwithholding of inculpatory evidence be considered when determining the granting of summary\njudgernent?\n        Can pro-se Plaintiffs proceeding in forma pauperis, who are unable to afford the\nexpensive depositions and interrogatories be allowed to use their pleadings and briefs as\naffidavits of their testimony when the documents are written and edited first hand by the\nPlaintiffs and presented in reply briefs as sworn, notarized statements?\n\f           Rule 56 (l)(A) Plaintiffs cited to particular materials in the record including Jim\n       Bethards testimonies, police reports, documents, electronically stored information and\n       declerations, admissions and other materials on the record.\n\n            Rule 56 (4) Do the Mayfield's pro-se declerations in their pleadings, replies and sur-\n       replies, all made from personal knowledge, be used to support facts that are admissible in\n       evidence?\n\n\nD.      Did the Appellate court use the wrong legal standard when it upheld the dismissal of the\nPlaintiffs motion for summary judgement when the facts show that the movants were entitled to\njudgement in their favor as a matter of law?\n\n\nUnlawful entry onto private property for the sole purpose of seizing evidence corrodes our civil\nliberties and weakens the Fourth Amendment to the point that it's protections have become\ninsignificant. We the Plaintiffs-Appellants-Petitioners plead for the Court to provide us with an\n\"Equal Justice Under Law.\" The ultimate outcome of this case goes far beyond the personal\ninterest of the Plaintiffs.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States should grant Certiorari",

The Eighth Circuit held that Mr. Wright was seeking\nrelief based on a non-retroactive procedural rule, and he was not\nentitled to relief because the conspiracy extended past his 18th\nbirthday. The Eighth Circuit also declined to decide whether a term-\nof-years sentence can effectively be a life without parole sentence.\n     The questions raised by this petition are:\n   Whether, in imposing sentence for an ongoing offense, courts must\n   consider juvenile conduct as a mitigating sentencing factor?\n\n   Whether, in imposing sentence for a juvenile, a term-of-years\n   sentence that deprives the juvenile of any meaningful\n   opportunity for release, would violate the Eighth Amendment?\n\n\n\n                               1",

On May 20, 2009,\n    Congress amended the Federal money-laundering statute to define the\n\n    proceeds as being gross receipts effectively overriding Santos.\n\n    (see; 18 U.S.C. §1956(c)(9)).\n\n             Almost immediately, after the Santos decision The United\n    States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the\n    same court that Bolze was convicted in months later) issued a Memo-\n    randum and Order in United States v. Thompson. The Court recognized\n\n    the law changed under Santos. The Court believed that since the\n    Sixth Circuit, at that time, had not spoken on Santos, the proper\n\n    course of action was for the government to bare its burden at trial.\n    Thompson went to trial and was found innocence of violating the money\n\n    laundering statute under Santos    (See Attached Exhibit A, Doc. 95\n    PagelD 202.\n\n             Across the heartland, other defendants also sought relief\n    under Santos. Defendants in the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth\n\n    Circuit were successfulr1 Their success created a framework of\n    favorable cases for other defendants to consider in reaching informed\n    strategic choices, including Bolze.\n\n             Bolze was arrested arrested and at arraignment, counsel\n\n    was appointed to represent Bolze. Counsel immediately advised Bolze\n\n    FOOTNOTE 1: United States v. Shelburne, 563 F. Supp. 2d 601 ) 2008\n    U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86387 (W.D. Va., July 1, 2008); United States v.\n    Herlund, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98371 (N.m Cal., Sept. 9, 2008);\n    United States v. Achoba, 560 F. 3d 274 (5th Cir. Dec. )18 2008);\n    United States v. Lee, 558 F. 3d 638, 650 (7th Cir. Mar. 11, 2009);\n    United States v. Smith, 622 F. Supp. 2d 693; 2009 U.S. Dist LEXIS\n    35222 (W.D.

Bolze, a layman, was a Federal detainee at the\nC'   Blount County Detention Center and was not permitted to visit or\n     allowed to conduct any legal research. (See; Bolze v. U.S., 3:12-\n\n     cv-473 (E.D. Tenn 2012) Doc. 110-2, Affidavits).\n\n              Bolze was indict on July 21, 2009 for operating a Ponzi\n     scheme from \"April 2002 through in or about December 2008,\" (see\n     U.S. v. Bolze, 3:09-cr-0093 (E.D. Tenn 2009) Doc. 23, Indict; Doc.\n     43, Plea; and PSR).\n\n              Bolze had drafted a hand-written plea, pleading guilty to\n     One-Count of money laundering (based on the Complaint) without any\n     counsel's input or legal advice. Counsel's performance fell below\n     an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to investigate\n\n     Santos or even attempt any adversarial testing of the government's\n\n     charges, before simply submitting the unknowing plea to the Govern-\n     ment. When counsel submitted the initial plea, he began the \"criti-\n\n     cal stage\" of plea negotiations. After further negotiations, the\n     Government on August 27, 2009, offerred its version to counsel.\n\n     The government's version also contained One-Count of Money-Laundering.\n\n              On September 2, 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals\n     rendered a decision in United States v. Kratt, 579 F. 3d 558, 566\n     (6th Cir. 2009).\n\n              Bolze would ultimately be convicted of all three Counts of\n     money laundering pursuant to an unlcnonwing plea. Bolze sentencing\n     guidelines was enhanced under U.S.S.G. §251.1(b)(1)(A) based on the\n\n     conviction under §1957. (See PSR).\n\n             The District Court sentenced Bolze to the high-end of the\n\n                                  -iii-\n\f    resulting Guidelines range to 240 months imprisonment for the wire\n    fraud charges and 87 months months (consecutive) for the conviction\n\n    of the money laundering charges.\n\n             Bolze filed a timely 28 U.S.C.'2255 seeking relief from\n    counsel's egrogeously deficent conduct. Bolze claimed that he was\n    factually innocence of committing a violation of §1957 under Santos\n\n    in his petition.\n\n             Although the Court recognized this claim, the Court then\n    determined that three Sixth Circuit decision rendered after counsel's\n    challenged deficient acts or omissions foreclosed any relief under\n\n    Santos. (Doc. 145, Denial, PagelD 2956).\n\n             The Court did not provide any anlysis of Strickland's two\n    prongs for ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The Court also\n\n    did not provide analysis under Padilla, Lafler, or Frye where the\n    claim involved an unknowing plea.\n\n             The habeas proceeding did not allow discovery, or submission\n    of affidavits from trial counsel, or an evidentiary hearing in the\n\n    reaching of the merits of the determination to deny relief.\n\n             The habeas proceeding committed a defect in the judicial\n    proceeding by it mis-applied the law at the time of claim   -   a true\n    ex post facto violations of due process. (see U.S. Const. art 1,\n\n    10, cl 1).\n\n             Mr. Bolze went on to unsuccessfully appeal for a Certificate\n    of Appealability and became barred from asserting actual innocence.\n\n    His only opportunity is in a Writ of Habeas Corpus which has been\n\n    suspended in the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nL                                 -iv-\n\f              Mr. Boize is deprived of the right to file a Writ\n                                                                 of Habeas\n     Corpus, based on a miscarrage of justicei only\n                                                     because he is now\n     incarcerated in the State of Florida.

Larimer of the district\n         court, directing and commanding these respondents to immediately\n\n         release the defendant ANDRE BARNES and to dismiss this/these action(s)\n\n         for lack of federal jurisdiction and to preserve the privilege against\n\n         unreasonable seizure- and the privilege against having to respond itL\n         any way to federal court's forfeiture suit in rem and complaint in\n         admiralty and prize jurisdiction as to petitioner as announced in this\n\n         Court's decision in 443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product, 266 US 172, 57\n\n         L.Ed 174, 33 S.Ct. 50.\n\n\n\n\n                     UNAVAILABILITY OF RELIEF IN OTHER COURTS\n\n\n            No other court can grant the relief sought by this petition\n\n         becuase only the Supreme Court is invested with the power to issue\n         a writ of - Prohibition on a district court proceeding as an admiralty\n\n         court in excess of its jurisdiction.\n\n\n         1. On 02/06/2018. the United States District Court for the Western\n\n         District of New York denied petitioner's request for Bail, Bond or\n\n         Immediate release of the defendant ANDRE BARNES.

Marangola on the grounds that because an\nindictment had been returned, petitioner's remedy could only lie\n\nthrough judgment on the merits and:direct appeal. A copy of this\nOrder is attached hereto in the Appendix. 49   -   50\n\n\n   On May 21, 2018 the District Court denied petitioner ANDRE BARNES'\npetition for habeas corpus relif on the grounds that - the Petitioner\n                                                    ,\nhad not alleged his detnetion was in violation of.-- the Constitution.\n\nA copy of this Order is attached hereto in the Appendix. 51    -   53\n\n\nIt is presumed that a defendant res is not entititled to the provsions\n\nof the 5th Amendment of the Constitution; futhermore that when a res\nis charged with acts of rebellion, belligerancy or war against the\nUnited States and in violation of the Law of Nations, such defendant\n\nres and any party having interest in such es-shalUhavetheright\nto writ of habeas corpus suspended. U.S. Const. art I, § 9(2).\n\nIt must be noted herein, that, the petitioner ANDRE BARNES, is not\n\na maritime vessel nor any other form of property or \"thing\" that\nmay be considered.a res and have a Title subject to forfeiture but\n\na Natrual Person and citizen and domiciliary of the United States\n\nand the State of New York. A copy of petitioner's Certificate of\nLive Birth is at                                        -69.\n\n\nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause, the phrase\n\n\"no person\" aplies botl1..to natrual and artificial persons.\n\n(See Natrual Person)              ---\n\n\n\n\n                                  vi.\n\f      On July 25, 2018 the District Court scheduled a Trial on the\n    merits as to the pleadings instruments herein. A copy of the this\n£\n\n    Ordder is attached hereto in the Appendix. 60\n\n\n       On October 11, 2018, the District Court denied petitioners motion\n    to dismiss alleging that the pleadings failed to state a cause of\n\n    action as the face of the instruments failed to allege a basis for\n    the federal court's jurisdiction and that there were no set of facts\n\n    within the record that would bring the claim(s) within the original\n\n    jurisdiction of the federal court. The district court dismissed the\n    motion(s) without addressing the jurisdictional facts.A copy of\n\n    of the Orrder is attached hereto in the Appendix. 76    -   87\n\n\n\n                UNSUITABILITY OF ANY OTHER FORM OF RELIEF\n\n       No other form of relief will be sufficient to be free from\n    unreasonable seizure and also not to be deprived of life, liberty\n\n    and property without due process of law or preserve the ability to\n\n    seek review in the lower court decision because a writ of prohibition\n    will not issue to a district court proceeding in a case of admiralty\n\n    and maritime cognizance in which it has no jurisdiction after the\n\n    wrongful prosecution has reached its final conclusion.\n\n    In the case of One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania 380 U.S. 693\n\n    702 7 14 L.Ed. 2d 170, 85 S.Ct 1246 (1965), this Court announced that\n     the right to be free from unlawful seizure applies to forfeiture\n\n     proceedings; In Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. 399 US\n\n     306, 314, 315, 94 L.Ed 865 (1950) this Court held that no person\n     shall be deprived life, liberty or property without due process of\n\n     law.\n\n\n                                  :Vii.\n\fIn Steel Co. V. Citizens for a Better Environment 523 U.S. 83\n140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), this Court required that the lower courts\nare required to determine the jurisdictional questions before pro\nceeding to to the merits. Rule 12(h) of the Fed.R.Civ.P requires\nan allegation of facts to show jurisdiction in the district court\nto be a prerequisite to a trial on the merits of an action.\nSubjecting the petitioner to the burdens of suit on the theory that\npetitioner will ultimately prevail on the merits essentially nullifies\nthe Due Process requirement recognized in Pennoyer v. Neff 95 U.S.\n714, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1887). (\"[T]here must be a tribunal competent\nby its constitution-that is by the laws of its creation-to pass upon\nthe subject-matter of the suit\").\n\n\nAs à.result this Court has understood the phrase \"court of competent\njurisdiction\" as a referrence to a court with an existing souce of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. Ex Parte Phenix Ins. Co. 118 U.S. 610\n7 S.Ct. 25, 30 L.Ed. 274 (1886), provides an example. \"Where there\nappears on the face of the proceedings that a district court has no\njurisdiction of an admiralty case, the case is one for writ of prohibition'!",

      "qp": "Mr. Daniels was found guilty, after a Jury Trial, of conspiracy to commit\n\n  a Hobbs Acts Robbery, two drug trafficking crimes and two firearm charges under\n\n 924(c). Mr. Daniels and Geary Lynch were approached at their residence by a\n\n Government Confidential informant (CI), Timothy Hylton, that would get them high\n\n and try to convince them to do a robbery. Mr. Daniels refused the Cl's offers on\n\n several occasions. Timothy Hylton, however, persisted in trying to get Mr.\n\n Daniels and others to do the robbery. Mr. Daniels continued to refuse Timothy\n\n Hylton's offers. But on December 28th, 2007 things changed when Mr. Daniels was\n\n arrested with Mr. Hylton's marijuana and ecstasy, and Mr. Hylton gave Geary\n\n Lynch $100.00 to help Mr. Lynch post Mr. Daniels' bond. Timothy Hylton began to\n\n harass Mr. Daniels about money owed to him (Mr. Hylton) for drugs he (Mr.\n\n Daniels) had gotten arrested with as well as the $100.00 given to put up for Mr.\n\n Daniels' bond. Mr. Hylton's harassment reached the point of forcing Marijuana\n\n and ecstasy on Mr. Daniels so he could sell it to clear his debt. Mr. Daniels\n\nrefused Mr. Hylton's offer to sell drugs and told him to count the bond money as\n\nwell as the weed and ecstasy lost in his arrest as a loss. Mr. Hylton then\n\nthreatened Mr. Daniels by brandishing a firearm and stating that he doesn't take\n\nlosses. After threatening Mr. Daniels, Mr. Hylton than gave Mr. Daniels an\n\nultimatum: Mr. Daniels could sell the drugs or do the robbery he had refused to\n\ndo on several occasions.\n\n      On January 16, 2008 Mr. Daniels was 19 years old and under the drinking\n\nage when he was given an alcoholic beverage by the case Agent, Michael Conners,\n\nATF, in his case. After giving Mr. Daniels an alcoholic beverage he proceeded to\n\ndiscuss doing the robbery in this case. After being arrested Mr. Daniels was\n\nsearched for weapons and later place in the back of a police unit with Geary\n\nLynch. Officers warned Mr. Daniels and Mr. Lynch that the car had been searched\n\n\n\n                                       iii\n\f and that any drugs found would belong to them (Daniels & Lynch). After being\n\n left in the police car Mr. Daniels discovered that 3 bags of Marijuana laced\n\n with ecstasy that he brought with him from the stash Timothy Hylton gave him was\n\n still on his person. Mr. Daniels was a drug user who liked to lace his marijuana\n\n with ecstasy as opposed to taking the pill and he had brought the three bags of\n\n marijuana laced with ecstasy to smoke. Through the help of Geary Lynch Mr.\n\n Daniels, with the officers warning in mind, swallowed these drugs so that they\n\n would not be later found on his person or in the back of the police car. Mr.\n\n Daniels was later taken to ATF headquarters where he gave statements to ATF\n\n while under the influence of alcohol given to him by the case agent and drugs he\n\nreceived from the Government's informant.\n\n      Mr. Daniels attempted to suppress the statements due to drug intoxication\n\nbut counsel refused to raise the issue that government agents were responsible\n\nfor giving a minor alcohol, and that the drugs Daniels had taken in the police\n\ncar were provided by the Government's CI. Agent Connors testified about Mr.\n\nDaniels' demeanor at the time of his Miranda statements. Agent Connors testimony\n\nwas not inconsistent with someone under the influence of Marijuana or ecstasy.\n\nMr. Connors testified, more in regards to the effects of someone under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol. Mr. Daniels also testified at the suppression hearing and\n\nhis testimony was more consistent with someone under the influence of ecstasy\n\nand marijuana.\n\n      The Suppression question was not raised on appeal. Appeal counsel forgot\n\nand tried to supplement with an argument that Mr. Daniels    had written.,-' The\n\nElelventh Circuit of the Court of appeal denied the motion to supplement and\n\nthe issue was never heard by The Court of Appeals.\n\n      Mr. Daniels filed a timely, pro se motion, under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 which\n\nwas subsequently denied.\n\n     Mr. Daniels also file two 60(b) motions; one was subsequently denied in\n\n\n\n                                        iv\n\fthe Eleventh Circuit for the Court of Appeals, the other was denied in the\n\ndistrict court and no Certificate of Appealability was sought.\n\n         Mr. Daniels was deprived of Due Process and post conviction relief, and\n\nnow as a prisoner in the Eleventh Circuit Mr. Daniels is deprived of the right\n\nto file a Writ of Habeas Corpus based on a manifest miscarriage of justice\n\nwhere no crime was ever committed by Mr. Daniels.\n\n         On March 14, 2017 the Eleventh Circuit of the United States Court of\n\nAppeals decided McCarthan v. Director of Goodwill Industries   -   Suncoast, Inc.,\n\n851 F.3d 1076 (11th Cir. 2017) (en baric), where the Eleventh Circuit\n\neffectively suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus to those with actual innocence\n\nclaims in three of the fifty United States. Thus, Mr. Daniels presents for\n\nresolution, the questions that follow:\n\n\n\n            Has the Eleventh Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals\n\neffectively suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus, without authorization, where\n\nthe Court has overruled its entire line of Saving Clause precedent to narrow\n\nthe circumstance under which a federal prisoner can proceed under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§2241?\n\n            Does the difference between the Fourth and Eleventh Circuit\n\ndecisions, concerning the Saving Clause interpretations, call for the exercise\n\nof this Court's Supervisory power, to the end that it may secure the equal\n\nprotection of law?\n\n            Has the Eleventh Circuit established a procedural framework, by\n\nreason of its design and operation, that made it highly unlikely in a typical\n\ncase that a prisoner, with an actual innocence claim, would have a meaningful\n\nopportunity to challenge his conviction as a manifest miscarriage of justice?\n\n\n\n\n                                         IN",
